    <h2>Fun facts about me:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I was born at 3:33am, in room 9, on 333 E. Superior street. Due to this, I think of 3s and 9s as my lucky numbers.</li>

    <h2>Future Goals</h2>
    <p>I love <strong>computer science</strong> and have studied it for a long time, but at an internship I started over the summer, I was able to experience the intersection of computer science and biology. Because of that and a previous interest in psychology, I am interested in being a psychiatrist or pediatric doctor who does research on the side using computer science!</p>
    <p>When I am older, I want to have two cats. Technically I am allergic to cats... however allergy pills work for me and I will persevere in order to fulfill my dream of having cats!</p>
    <p>I also want to travel all the countries in the world. The top at my list at the moment are <strong>Nigeria, Japan, Argentina, France, India, and Mexico</strong>.</p>
